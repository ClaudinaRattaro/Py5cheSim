# Py5cheSim
Py5cheSim is a flexible and open-source simulator based on Python and 
specially oriented to simulate cell capacity in 3GPP 5G networks and beyond. 
To the best of our knowledge, Py5cheSim is the first simulator that supports 
Network Slicing at the Radio Access Network (RAN), one of the main innovations of 5G.
